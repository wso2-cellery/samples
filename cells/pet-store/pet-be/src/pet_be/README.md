## Pet store pet-be cell

This pet store backend cell consists of 4 microservices.

* Catalog (Catalog of the accessories available in the pet store)
* Customers (Existing customers of the Pet Store)
* Orders (Orders placed at the Pet Store by Customers)
* Controller (Controller service which fetches data from the above 3 microservices and processes them to provide useful functionality)

All 4 micro services are implemented in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 


### Pet-be cell
The below shown is the cell file for the pet-be cell which is in [pet-be.bal](pet-be.bal).

```bash

    // This component deals with all the orders related functionality.

### Build method 
- The `build` method will be executed when `cellery build` is performed, and user can pass the `cellery:ImageName iName` as a parameter during cellery build. 
And therefore the controller component's HttpAPIIngress's API definition is updated by reading the swagger file in the `build` method.
- There are four components defined to deploy four micro-services (catalog, orders, customers, and controller), and all four components have HTTP ingress to receive the external requests. 
- Only `controller` component has defined `expose` parameter to `local` in the [HttpAPIIngress](https://github.com/wso2/cellery-spec#1-http-ingresses), 
and therefore only `controller` component is exposed as cell API, and all other three components are only accessible within the cell and not from other cells.
- The API definition of the controller micro service is defined in the swagger file [pet-store.swagger.json](../../../src/pet-store/pet-be/controller/resources/pet-store.swagger.json). 
- The `controller` component cell has defined `envVars` to get the runtime value of host and ports for other components catalog, customer, and orders. 
- All four components are defined included in the cell during `petStoreBackendCell` initialization.
- `cellery:getHost` method will return the actual host value of other micro-services components so that respective `envVars` will be properly set at the `controller` component.
- Finally, the method `cellery:createImage` within the `build` method will create the cell image.

### Run method
- The `run` method will be executed when `cellery run` is performed.
- `cellery:ImageName iName` will be passed into the run method which will have both cell image and the corresponding instance name that the cellery runtime should spawn.
- As the cell image is already built during `build` method, users can only change the `envVars` in the component and pass those as runtime values.
- Finally, the method `cellery:createInstance` will spawn an instance of the `cellery:ImageName iName`

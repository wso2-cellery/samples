## Pet store pet-fe cell
The portal web application is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application, and it invokes the pet-be cell to get the 
data based on the business logic and logged in user. 

### Development of portal app
- The front end logic is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), and it make calls to pet-be.
- The swagger file of the pet-fe can be fetched by executing command [`cellery extract-resources`](https://github.com/wso2/cellery/blob/master/docs/cli-reference.md#extract-resources) 
which will extract the swagger file in the same location where you run the command.
  ```
  cellery extract-resources wso2cellery/cells-pet-fe:latest
  ```
- Then based on the swagger file, the [client source](../../../src/pet-store/pet-fe/portal/src/gen/petStoreApi.js) is generated which can be used to invoke the pet-fe cell.

### Pet-fe cell
The below shown is the cell file for the pet-fe cell which is in [pet-fe.bal](pet-fe.bal).

#### Build method
- The pet-fe cell consists of one component `portalComponent` which has a web ingress that is exposed globally by default.
- The `gatewayConfig` in the `portalComponent` defines the configurations such as [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) configurations, 
vhost and context properties. By default all context of the `portalComponent` is secured and hence when the user tries to access the any page in the `portalComponent`, 
the user will be redirected to login page. 
- As `portalComponent` has a landing page which is not secured, `nonSecurePaths` is defined with contexts `["/", "/app/*"]`.
- The secured configurations of the `oidc` elements are left blank, and it'll be populated during the runtime by extracting the runtime configurations provided by user.
- The pet-fe cell depends on pet-be cell, and it's defined in the `dependencies` section in the `portalComponent`.
- As the pet-fe cell depends on pet-be cell, method `cellery:getReference(portalComponent, "petStoreBackend").controller_api_url` will help to resolve the actual controller API url in `portalComponent`.
- The build method is executed when `cellery build` is performed, and it creates the cell image with the method `cellery:createImage`.

#### Run method
- The `run` method will be executed when `cellery run` is performed.
- `cellery:ImageName iName` will be passed into the run method which will have both cell image and the corresponding instance name that the cellery runtime should spawn.
- The `oidc` configurations such as `providerUrl`, `clientId`, `dcrUser`, and `dcrPassword` are loaded from the runtime parameters, and will use the default values if there is no runtime parameters provided.
- Finally, the method `cellery:createInstance` will spawn an instance of the `cellery:ImageName iName`
